# QE Calculation of Diamane properties
## Introduction
> 2D materials are becoming more promising materials for the next generation of (opto-)electronic devices and other high-tech applications due to their unique electronic and optical properties. Although 2D materials hold great promise for electronics, optical and quantum devices, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize their potential. Research in this area will help find materials with the desired properties for various applications. <br>

> First predicted in 2009, diamane is a bilayer sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized graphene that transforms into an sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized structure by forming a covalent bond. Two atoms are incorporated with hydrogen (or fluorine) atoms defining the C<sub>2</sub>H structure and, when combined with another layer of carbons, form a covalent bond, thereby leading to the formation of a new structure called diamane and shown in Figure.
